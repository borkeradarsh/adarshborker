# Contact Form Setup Guide

## Current Form Limitations
Your contact form currently only shows a success message but doesn't actually send emails. Here are several solutions to receive form submissions:

## Option 1: Formspree (Recommended - Free & Easy)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) and create a free account
2. Create a new form and get your form endpoint URL
3. Replace the form action in your contact page with the Formspree endpoint
4. You'll receive emails directly to your Gmail inbox

**Steps:**
- Sign up at formspree.io
- Create a new form
- Copy the form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)
- Update the form in `app/contact/page.tsx`

## Option 2: Netlify Forms (If deploying to Netlify)
1. Add `data-netlify="true"` to your form
2. Deploy to Netlify
3. Forms will be handled automatically

## Option 3: EmailJS (Client-side)
1. Sign up at [emailjs.com](https://www.emailjs.com/)
2. Set up email service (Gmail)
3. Install emailjs: `npm install @emailjs/browser`
4. Configure the form to send emails directly from the browser

## Option 4: Custom Backend
Create your own API endpoint using:
- Node.js + Express + Nodemailer
- Next.js API routes + Nodemailer
- Serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify)

## Recommended Quick Setup (Formspree)
I've prepared your form to work with Formspree. Just:
1. Sign up at formspree.io
2. Create a form
3. Replace `YOUR_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT` in the contact page with your actual endpoint
4. You'll start receiving emails immediately!
